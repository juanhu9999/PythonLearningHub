# PythonLearningHub

Welcome to my Python Learning Hub! This is a centralized repository where I store various Python projects and exercises related to my ongoing learning and training. 

## Description

PythonLearningHub includes code snippets, notes, and complete projects from different courses and tutorials. The main focus areas are back-end development, Django, and Artificial Intelligence. It serves as a comprehensive resource for tracking my progress and sharing my journey in mastering Python.

## Current Courses

The following is a list of courses that I am currently taking and will be updating the repository with:

- More Python Tips, Tricks, and Techniques for Data Science

## Future Courses

I plan to expand my knowledge on Python by taking more courses related to back-end development, Django, and AI. Stay tuned for more updates!

## Repository Structure

Each course will have its own directory, which will contain subdirectories for each project or exercise. As I progress through my learning journey, the repository structure will evolve accordingly.

## Usage

Most of the code in this repository can be run in any Python environment. Some projects may require additional libraries, which will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file in the project's directory.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal educational use, suggestions and advice from other developers are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have something to contribute.
